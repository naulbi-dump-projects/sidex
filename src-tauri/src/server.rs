//! Local agent server supervisor.
//!
//! `SideX`'s agent loop, tools, MCP and memory all live in `sidex-server`. With
//! no account there is no hosted instance to talk to, so the app runs its own
//! copy: a child process bound to loopback, started on launch and stopped when
//! the app exits.
//!
//! The server is given provider credentials through its environment (see
//! `providers::server_env`), so keys never reach the webview and never land in
//! a config file.
//!
//! Spawning happens off the calling thread and is retried a bounded number of
//! times (`MAX_SPAWN_ATTEMPTS`) if the health check never passes — the port
//! reserved by `free_port` can be taken before the child binds it. Once the
//! server is up, a lightweight watchdog notices if it dies later and tries to
//! bring it back, also bounded (`MAX_CRASH_RESTARTS`), so a server that is
//! crash-looping on its own doesn't spin the watchdog forever.
